# How to Deploy Symfony

[Source](/recipe/symfony.php)

## How to deploy a Symfony project with zero downtime?

First, [install](/docs/installation.md) the Deployer. 
Second, require `recipe/symfony.php` recipe into your _deploy.php_ or _deploy.yaml_ file.
Third, run `dep deploy` command.

Did you know that you can deploy **Symfony** project with a single command? Just execute `dep deploy`.
Also, you can take an advantage of the [Deployer's CLI](/docs/cli.md) to deploy your project.

Another cool feature of the Deployer is provisioning. Take any server, and run `dep provision` command.
This command will configure webserver, databases, php, https, and more. 
You will get everything you need to run your **Symfony** project.

The symfony recipe is based on [common](/docs/recipe/common.md) recipe.
